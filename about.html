		    		<h3>the photographer</h3>
		    		<p>i've always had an interest in photography since my parents first bought a DSLR camera. since then, i've always brought it along on vacations, usually to take pictures of wildlife (like the two shown here, taken on a vacation to argentina). this project would be my first time actually going out and looking for a vague idea for a photo, capturing whatever inspires me, and then organizing them into a kind of gallery or collection which i think is worth sharing.</p>
